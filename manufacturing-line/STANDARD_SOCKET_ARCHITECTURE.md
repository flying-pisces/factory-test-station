)

# IC Components  
DiscreteEventProfile(
    event_name="smt_place_ic", 
    duration=2.0,      # 2 seconds per IC placement
    frequency=1800,    # 1800 placements per hour max
    variability=0.2    # ±20% duration variation
)
```

### **Station Level Events**
```python
DiscreteEventProfile(
    event_name="SMT_process_cycle",
    duration=31.0,     # Total station cycle time
    frequency=116,     # 116 cycles per hour
    variability=0.15   # ±15% cycle variation
